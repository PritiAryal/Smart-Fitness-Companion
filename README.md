## Overview

Smart Fitness Companion leverages cutting-edge technologies and AI to transform the fitness journey for users. Designed with scalability, security, and personalization at its core, this platform aims to empower users to achieve their fitness goals through tailored workout plans, progress analytics, and seamless, secure access.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Personalized Workouts:** AI-driven routines and recommendations using Gemini AI.
- **Progress Tracking:** Intelligent analytics to monitor improvements and suggest next steps.
- **User Security:** Enterprise-grade authentication and authorization powered by Keycloak.
- **Modern Microservices:** Each functional domain (user management, workouts, tracking, etc.) is isolated for agility and scalability.
- **Robust Communication:** Asynchronous service integration via RabbitMQ.
- **Flexible Data Storage:** Support for PostgreSQL/MySQL.
- **Service Discovery & Gateway:** Eureka and Spring Cloud Gateway for dynamic routing and service registration.
- **Web Interface:** Responsive frontend with React.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React (planned)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot Microservices
- **Service Discovery:** Eureka
- **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Keycloak
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **AI/ML:** Gemini AI (planned integration)
- **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD pipelines (planned)

## Microservice Architecture

Each feature domain (users, activity etc.) is implemented as a separate microservice for scalability and maintainability. The current focus is the **user microservice**.

---

## User Microservice

### Features

- User registration and retrieval
- Role-based access via `UserRole` enum
- Secure data persistence using PostgreSQL
- RESTful API endpoints for core user operations

### Key Implementation Details

- **User entity** and **UserRole enum** defined in the domain layer.
- **Database connection** configured via `application.yml`.
- **Repository, service interface, and implementation** layers structured for clean separation of concerns.
- **UserController** exposes REST endpoints for creating and fetching users.
- **DTOs** used for request/response mapping, ensuring clean API contracts.
- **Endpoints verified** using HTTP request definitions in the `api-requests` directory.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint        | Description             |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|
| POST   | `/register`       | Create a new user       |
| GET    | `/users/{id}`  | Retrieve user by ID     |

> See the `api-requests` directory for example HTTP requests.

### Request & Response DTOs

- **UserRequestDTO**: Used for user creation requests.
- **UserResponseDTO**: Used for user responses.

---

### Configuration

- Database connection settings are managed in `src/main/resources/application.yml`.

---

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PritiAryal/Smart-Fitness-Companion.git
   cd Smart-Fitness-Companion
   ```

2. **Set up PostgreSQL** and configure your credentials in `application.yml`.

3. **Build and run the user microservice:**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Test endpoints** using sample HTTP requests in the `api-requests` directory.

### Current Progress

The initial phase focuses on building a robust **user service** as the foundation for secure and scalable user management. This includes:

- User registration and authentication endpoints
- Integration plans for Keycloak (OAuth2)
- Data persistence with relational databases (PostgreSQL)
- Microservice-ready architecture using Spring Boot

> **Note:** Details on endpoints, usage, and deployment instructions will be included as the implementation progresses.

> The codebase is evolving; as of now, the primary focus is on the backend user service. Additional microservices and the frontend will be introduced in subsequent phases.
